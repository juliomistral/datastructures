# datastructures

An educational project where I identify and implement simple data structures and algorithms.  

These are for educational purposes and represent the principles behind the data structures - effecient insertion and lookup, minimizing memory usage, etc.  However, they are not bullet-proof production code (ie, not thread safe, naive resizing, etc.).
